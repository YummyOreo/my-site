# Projects
My current open-source projects

#### [Red-Phos](https://github.com/YummyOreo/red-phosphorus)
This project is aimed at providing a *fast* minecraft redstone emulator. Currently it is not in a usable state, and progress is going slowly.

#### [Pindow](https://github.com/YummyOreo/Pindow)
Pindow allows you to have a list of "pinned" apps, open each one with one keybind. Currently not in active development
